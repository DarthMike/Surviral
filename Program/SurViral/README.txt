and ultimately reach the critical section, that is, your goal. Antivirus is searching for you, 
and it will destroy you in 10 seconds. Spread the virus to fool it and continue to your goal. 
Your only weapon is moving and corrupting data chunks, so and infecting them spreading your virus, 
to gain you time.
