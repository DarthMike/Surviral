# SurViral

## Overview

**Surviral** is a game made in the course of 10 days aproximatedly, but I didn't get much time to it, because of personal reasons.

It is **an entry to Experimental Gameplay Project of March: 10 Seconds.**

SurViral requires you to SURVIVE being a small computer virus. Infect everything you can, and ultimately reach the critical section, that is, your goal. Antivirus is searching for you, and it will destroy you in 10 seconds. Spread the virus to fool it and continue to your goal. 

Your only weapon is moving and corrupting data chunks, so and infecting them spreading your virus, to gain you time.

**It is more a prototype, as it only features 2 levels... quite a proof of concept and really no more…**
